# Notes to self

- Started the project.
- Constructed the basic machine and copied Fraser's `assign` and whatever
  else over.
- But the machine is barely started.
- Installed `react-hook-form` and started a basic `LoginForm` but then realised
  I was getting distracted and stopped.
- Created a test but also realised that was a distraction so stopped.

### Next session

- Go back to the machine.
- Get it working, minimally, with an ugly-AF signin form and logout button,
  all just in one component.
- **The machine is the most important thing.**

- Added `strict: "true"`.
- More machine work, we're now trying to get the 'LOGIN' action working.
  - With a hard-coded username & password for now, rather than a form.
  - Which didn't work because you deleted the users! D'oh!
- So now you need to re-create the signup form, which is okay.
