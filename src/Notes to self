# Notes to self

## 2020-05-26 17:09

- Started the project.
- Constructed the basic machine and copied Fraser's `assign` and whatever
  else over.
- But the machine is barely started.
- Installed `react-hook-form` and started a basic `LoginForm` but then realised
  I was getting distracted and stopped.
- Created a test but also realised that was a distraction so stopped.

### Next session

- Go back to the machine.
- Get it working, minimally, with an ugly-AF signin form and logout button,
  all just in one component.
- **The machine is the most important thing.**
